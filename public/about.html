<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
<p>Doomed by the need to excel at everything I try, I embarked into technology in the most difficult way possible.</p>

<p>Born in 2003, I've always had a fascination with art, creativity, expression and visual concepts.<br>In 2024, I finally decided to mix
my knowledge in art, both digital and traditional with something new, exciting, and really hard to understand at times.</p>
